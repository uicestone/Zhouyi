				studied between London and Paris with degrees in Political Science and 
				Economics, Yi Zhou is a polyglot artist whose work has been shown at 
				Shanghai Biennale, Venice Biennale and Sundance Film Festival, Cannes Film 
				Festival since the past 10 years.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yi Zhou was named as the first ever artist-ambassador to endorse a beauty 
				brand; Clarins, from 2010 to 2011. Loved by luxury brands for her multidisciplinary range as an artist, since 2012 she has also started collaborationswith brands such as Italian luxury eyewear brand Persol and Hogan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her diverse interests and compacity to range her multimedia work have also 
				been shown through her much-acclaimed collaborations such as with the 
				French couture jewelry house Gripoix; a first successful artist-collection 
				entitled “Pineapple’s Secret”. Her animations have also inspired clothing 
				collection by the French hip brand, Each x Other.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2013, Yi Zhou has also been invited as the very first Chinese talent to 
				be hired as a designer and creative director of a brand to do an articulated 
				complete project ranging from men’s wear, women’s wear and accessories for 
				Iceberg. “Breaking the Ice” capsule collection will be released in December 
				2013 world wide.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since 2010 she has relocated back to China and founded her studio and 
				production company in Shanghai, creating job opportunities for young 
				Chinese people to work and experiment together on international projects. 
				An image maker and muse, switching from the front to the back of the 
				camera, Yi Zhou is a modern-day Chinese Hitchcock, Yoko Ono and Cindy 
				Sherman. Currently, Yi Zhou is also Tudou.com’s (Chinese would-be youtube) 
				art-director and serves as art and fashion advisory member at Sina.com 
				(which owns Chinese twitter).
			</p>
			<p>
				If Yi Zhou’s work is not pop, the life she has been embracing reminds of Andy 
				Warhol’s philosophy: establishing her work as leading video artist, ranging 
				her works from 3D animations to sculptures, music composition, filmmaking, 
				acting as active promoter of East meets West culture at key leading events 
				such as TEDx (Paris in 2012 and Beijing in 2013) and Women’s Forum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like Andy Warhol at his time, her work is also recognized by members of 
				highly diverse social circles such as distinguished intellectuals, Hollywood 
				celebrities and wealthy patrons and young social media audience
